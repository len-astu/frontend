This document outlines the high-level structure of your e-commerce platform, including how different components interact with each other and the overall architecture design. It should provide a clear picture of how the system works as a whole.

# System Architecture

## Overview

The system is designed using a microservices architecture. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, while the frontend uses React for a responsive, dynamic user interface. MongoDB is used for the database, with Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

## Key Components

- **Frontend**: React application communicates with the backend APIs to fetch and display data.
- **Backend**:
  - **API Gateway**: Handles incoming API requests and forwards them to the appropriate microservice.
  - **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication (JWT-based).
  - **Product Service**: Handles product management (CRUD operations).
  - **Order Service**: Handles order creation, processing, and tracking.
  - **Payment Service**: Integrates with Stripe/PayPal for payment processing.
  - **Email Service**: Sends email notifications for order confirmations, password resets, etc.
- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB**: Stores user data, product information, and order details.
  - **Redis**: Caches product data, shopping cart, and session information for performance.

## Data Flow

1. **User Login**: 
   - The user sends a login request to the Authentication Service.
   - The service validates the credentials and returns a JWT token.

2. **Product Search**: 
   - The frontend sends a request to the Product Service to retrieve product details.
   - The service queries the MongoDB database and returns the product data.
   - Frequently accessed products are cached in Redis for faster retrieval.

3. **Order Creation**: 
   - The customer adds products to their cart and proceeds to checkout.
   - An order request is sent to the Order Service, which processes it and sends it to the Payment Service for payment processing.

## Infrastructure

- **Web Server**: Node.js with Express, running in a Docker container.
- **Database**: MongoDB and Redis, both deployed in separate containers using Docker.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend instances.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional payment providers.
- Multi-region support for global customers.
