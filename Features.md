### 6. **DeveloperGuide.md** — **Developer Onboarding and Setup Instructions**

This document helps onboard new developers and outlines the steps to set up the local development environment and contribute to the project.

#### Structure:

# Developer Guide

## Prerequisites

To get started with the project, you need to have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Docker** (for containerized services)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance)
- **Redis** (local or cloud instance)
- **Git** (to clone and manage the repository)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ecommerce-platform.git
   cd ecommerce-platform

# System Architecture

## Overview

The system is designed using a **microservices architecture** with various services responsible for different functionalities. Each service operates independently, allowing for easier scalability, maintenance, and testing. The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, while the frontend utilizes **React** to create a responsive, dynamic user experience. **MongoDB** is used for data storage, and **Redis** is leveraged for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.

## Key Components

- **Frontend**: 
  - Built with **React**, it communicates with the backend APIs to display dynamic data such as product listings, user information, and orders.
  - Uses **Redux** for state management and **React Router** for handling navigation between pages.
  - **Axios** or **Fetch API** is used to make API requests to the backend.

- **Backend**:
  - **API Gateway**: Handles incoming API requests and forwards them to the appropriate microservice. It serves as the main entry point for all client requests.
  - **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization, handling JWT token creation and validation.
  - **Product Service**: Responsible for product management, including creating, updating, and deleting products. It also handles product search and filtering.
  - **Order Service**: Manages customer orders, from creation to tracking, and integrates with the Payment Service for payment processing.
  - **Payment Service**: Handles all payment-related tasks, integrating with **Stripe** and **PayPal** for processing payments.
  - **Email Service**: Sends email notifications for events like order confirmations, account verification, and password resets.

- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user accounts, product details, order history, and other application data.
  - **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used for caching product information, user sessions, and the shopping cart to improve performance.

## Data Flow

1. **User Login**: 
   - The user sends a **POST** request to the **Authentication Service** with their login credentials (username and password).
   - The Authentication Service validates the credentials against the database, generates a JWT token, and returns the token to the frontend.
   - The frontend stores this token and sends it with subsequent requests to access protected routes.

2. **Product Search**: 
   - The frontend sends a **GET** request to the **Product Service** to retrieve a list of products based on search parameters.
   - The Product Service queries the **MongoDB** database for matching products.
   - Frequently accessed products are cached in **Redis** to reduce database load and increase response time.

3. **Order Creation**:
   - A customer adds products to their cart and proceeds to checkout. The frontend sends a **POST** request to the **Order Service** with the order details (e.g., user ID, product IDs, quantities).
   - The **Order Service** creates a new order in the **MongoDB** database and sends a request to the **Payment Service** to process payment.
   - Once the payment is successful, the **Payment Service** confirms the payment and updates the order status.

## Infrastructure

- **Web Server**:
  - The backend uses **Node.js** with **Express** to handle API requests. It is deployed in a **Docker container** for portability and scalability.
  
- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB** is used for storing data, including product listings, orders, and user information.
  - **Redis** is used to cache frequently accessed data like product details and user sessions to improve performance.
  
- **Load Balancer**:
  - A **load balancer** distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of the backend services to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- **CI/CD**:
  - The project integrates **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions** for **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)**. This enables automated testing, build, and deployment processes.
  - The CI/CD pipeline ensures that every change is automatically tested, built, and deployed to the staging or production environments.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Payment Providers**:
   - Plan to integrate more payment gateways such as **Google Pay**, **Apple Pay**, or **Cryptocurrency payments** for a wider customer base.
   
2. **Global Expansion**:
   - Enable **multi-region** support to cater to customers in different geographical locations, allowing for faster access to the platform and region-specific products.
   - **Language Localization**: Expand to support additional languages for a global user base.
   - **Currency Support**: Add more currency options for international customers.

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - **Inventory Forecasting**: Use AI and machine learning to predict product demand and optimize stock levels.
   - **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement algorithms to adjust pricing based on demand, stock levels, and market conditions.
