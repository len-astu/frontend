# Security Compliance

## GDPR Compliance

- **Data Collection**: We collect only necessary user data for account creation, order processing, and customer support.
- **User Consent**: Users must consent to the privacy policy and terms of service before using the platform.
- **Data Access**: Users have the right to request a copy of their data or request its deletion.
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.

## PCI Compliance

- **Payment Processing**: All payment information is handled by Stripe or PayPal, both of which are PCI-compliant services.
- **Data Storage**: We do not store sensitive payment data such as credit card numbers. This is handled by the payment provider.
- **Secure Transactions**: All transactions are processed over HTTPS using TLS encryption.

## Best Practices

- Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) for user passwords.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for admin and seller accounts.
- Regularly update libraries and dependencies to fix security vulnerabilities.
